# Opportunity Teams — Team Selling (`horilla_crm.opportunities.views.opportunity_team`)

## What this module does

Provides the **Team Selling** feature for opportunities: create named teams, assign default members with roles and access levels, then attach teams or individual members to individual opportunities.

---

## Feature flag: `TeamSellingRequiredMixin`

All team-selling views inherit this mixin. It gates access behind a runtime feature flag:

```python
class TeamSellingRequiredMixin:
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        if not team_selling_is_enabled():
            if request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
                response = HttpResponse(status=204)
                response["HX-Redirect"] = reverse("opportunities:team_selling_setup")
                return response
            return HttpResponseForbidden()
        return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

- **HTMX requests** → 204 + `HX-Redirect` header pointing at the setup page.
- **Non-HTMX requests** → HTTP 403.

The setup page (`TeamSellingSetupView`) and `ToggleTeamSellingView` are exempt from this mixin so users can enable the feature.

## Key patterns

### Condition rows for bulk member creation

`OpportunityTeamMemberCreateView` sets `condition_fields = ["user", "team_role", "opportunity_access_level"]` with `condition_model = None`. Each non-empty condition row produces one `OpportunityTeamMember` instance. Duplicate detection checks the `(user, team)` pair within the same submit.

### Duplicate prevention

Both team-level and opportunity-level member views use `check_duplicate_instance` to prevent inserting the same user twice:

- Team members: unique on `(user, team)`.
- Opportunity members: unique on `(user, opportunity)`.

### OpportunitySplit guard on delete

`OpportunityMembersDeleteView.delete()` checks whether the member being removed has a linked `OpportunitySplit` row before proceeding. If a split exists, deletion is blocked and an error message is returned.

### URL param normalization

Some HTMX chains can produce malformed query strings (e.g. `?obj=3?obj=3`). Views that read an `obj` query param strip trailing `?…` fragments via `obj.split("?")[0].strip()` before using the value.

### `_thread_local` active company

`OpportunityTeamFormView` and `AddDefaultTeamView` fall back to `_thread_local.active_company` when the company is not set on the form instance. This handles the case where the middleware-populated thread local is the only available company reference during save.
